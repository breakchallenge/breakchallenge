## My coding journey
🏢I had my first run-in with software development in my senior year of high school; a computer mathematical equations class that focused on Python to interpret data. During class, in all honesty, **I didn't enjoy coding**. It was too **verbose** for my understanding at the time, so for college I decided to pursue **mechanical engineering**.

### The discovery
✨The story of **Star Wars** led to my discovery of software development as my passion 2 years ago, after I graduated high school and started working towards my major at a local community college. A colleague of mine at the place I worked at the time did programming in his spare time. Through our **conversations** about programming, I realized that **I could be like him**, and I too could learn how to code on my own just **like him**.

### What I learned On My Own
😎During my journey towards becoming a **self-taught software developer**, I bought as many 📒**programming books** as my budget would allow. I followed **coding tutorials**, got **certificates** from online websites, and honed my skills the best way I knew how: practice. I learned everything from the basics of **Python **to data structures and web development, but I wasn't done yet.

### Joining a Coding Bootcamp
🥈I had the fantastic opportunity of joining a **coding bootcamp**. With what I had already learned during my journey, I decided this would be just the push that I needed to set me on the **right path**. I spent **3 months** learning a new language, styling techniques, best practices, and so much more.

### Who I am now
👨‍⚖️I am a full-stack web developer with experience in the **JS & Python Frameworks**, and more specifically: **Next, Nuxt, Svelte, Angular, and React for the frontend; Node.js, Express, Nest, Django, FastAPI, GraphQL, and REST API for the backend**; and *SQL and MongoDB for databases**.

### My Next Steps
💪I am currently targeting to be a **senior level software developer**, and my coding journey doesn't end there. I believe there is so much that I can accomplish with my skills, and I'm excited to apply them in a professional setting as well as continue to hone them in my personal time!🥇

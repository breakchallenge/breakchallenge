### The discovery
âœ¨The story of **Star Wars** led to my discovery of software development as my passion 8 years ago, after I graduated high school and started working towards my major at a local community college. A colleague of mine at the place I worked at the time did programming in his spare time. Through our **conversations** about programming, I realized that **I could be like him**, and I too could learn how to code on my own just **like him**.

### What I learned On My Own
ðŸ˜ŽDuring my journey towards becoming a **self-taught software developer**, I bought as many ðŸ“’**programming books** as my budget would allow. I followed **coding tutorials**, got **certificates** from online websites, and honed my skills the best way I knew how: practice. I learned everything from the basics of **Python **to data structures and web development, but I wasn't done yet.

### My Next Steps
ðŸ’ªI believe there is so much that I can accomplish with my skills, and I'm excited to apply them in a professional setting as well as continue to hone them in my personal time!ðŸ¥‡
